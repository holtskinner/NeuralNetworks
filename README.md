# Neural Networks Project
### Introduction
Neural Networks and Deep Learning are the biggest buzzwords in Computer Science today. One of the particular fields that shows a great deal of promise are Convolutional Neural Networks or CNN's these special neural networks use a process known as convolution to learn features in conjunction with traditional Back Propogation. CNNs are particularly useful for processing images because convolution itself treats the data as a 2D matrix. Many different pretrained models exist to process image recognition and they each provide different levels of accuracy and different specialties. There are also a number of APIs featuring pretrained networks to allow more developers to utilize image recognition technology. For this project, these different models and APIs will be compared and contrasted to determine the best use cases.
