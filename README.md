# Neural Networks Project
### Introduction
Neural Networks and Deep Learning are the biggest buzzwords in Computer Science today. One of the particular fields that shows a great deal of promise are Convolutional Neural Networks or CNN's these special neural networks use a process known as convolution to learn features in conjunction with traditional Back Propogation. CNNs are particularly useful for processing images because convolution itself treats the data as a 2D matrix. Many different pretrained models exist to process image recognition and they each provide different levels of accuracy and different specialties. There are also a number of APIs featuring pretrained networks to allow more developers to utilize image recognition technology. For this project, these different models and APIs will be compared and contrasted to determine the best use cases.

### Dataset
For simplicity purposes, all classifiers will be trained with a simple dataset that consists of cats and dogs. The classifiers will be analyzed based on their ability to differentiate between the two different creatures. The training set imcludes 8000 images, 4000 cats and 4000 dogs. The test set contains 2000 images, 1000 cats and 1000 dogs. While this dataset is simple, the purpose is to learn the process of the CNN and the basic construction, as well as comparing the models.
